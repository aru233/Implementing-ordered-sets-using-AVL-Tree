# Implementing-ordered-sets-using-AVL-Tree

Aim: Implement ordered set with suitable data structure.

An ordered set is a common data structure that supports O(log N) lookups, insertions
and removals. Ordered set is also sometimes used as an alternative to a hash map, for
example in STL’s map.

Following operation have been implemented:
● O(log N) insertion and removal.
● O(log N) check if contains a value.
● O(log N) to find the element in the set closest to some value.
● O(log N) to find k-th largest element in the set.
● O(log N) to count the number of elements in the set whose values fall into a
given range.
